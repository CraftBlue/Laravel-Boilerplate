# Craft Blue's Laravel Boilerplate

We built a boilerplate Laravel application to ensure web applications built by [Craft Blue](https://www.craftblue.com)
maintain a consistent set of standards for ourselves and our clients.

utilize our most commonly used vendor services.

## Initial Setup and Configuration ##

1. Ensure your hosting machine is up to date. For example, `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` for Ubuntu.
1. Follow any additional instructions provided on [Laravel 5.5 Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5#server-requirements).
1. Follow any additional instructions provided on [Laravel 5.5 Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5#configuration)
1. Our configuration defaults require you to install and configure `supervisor` for monitoring your queues, `beanstalk` for handling Laravel queues, and `redis` for session management.
1. You will need to globally install `composer`, `nodejs`, and `npm`. It's recommended that you install a newer version of `nodejs` than may otherwise be a default. This prevents issues when running `npm`.
1. You will want to first copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values as needed. We've described custom `.env` params below.
1. You will need to run `php artisan key:generate` to generate your own unique application key.
1. Run `composer update`.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. We always suggest installing `fail2ban` on your server and disabling root SSH logins.
1. We always suggest installing `monit` on your server to monitor processes such as nginx, apache, php-fpm, mysql, supervisor, fail2ban, etc.


## Default Config Value ##s

* Redis has been chosen as the default cache.
* Redis has been chosen as the default queue storage.
* Redis has been chosen as the default session storage.
* Beanstalk has been chosen as the default queue handler.
* MySQL has been chosen as the default database. Substitute your server  MariaDB if you'd like.
* File has been chosen as the default storage disk. You may wish to swap this out for Amazon S3.

## Additional Composer Packages Included ##

We've included the following non-standard packages in our composer.json file by default.

These decisions were made to not only simplify development, but improve overall application security.

* **debugging** [varryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
* **development** [itsgoingd/clockwork](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork) The server-side component of CLockword, a chrome extension for speeding up PHP development.
* **forms** [laravelcollective/html](https://github.com/LaravelCollective/html)
* **logging** [jenssegers/agent](https://github.com/jenssegers/agent) For enhanced logging of user agent strings as well as robot detection

## Automation with Travis CI ##

https://gist.github.com/gilbitron/5cac0ac5fa07e9b354ac

## Authentication


## Pre-Configured API

Laravel Passport has been pre-configured to give you OAUTH2 client/server functionality.

TODO: You still need to generate your own keys.


## Access Control (ACL)

Access control is managed by the [`spatie/laravel-permission`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) library.

Defaults roles have been added for `user`, `admin`, and `superadmin`.

Default permissions have been added for ``.



## Organizing and Creating Routes

You can organize routes into individual, role based files.

You can do this by including your route file in `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`. If you add a new route file to the `routes/` directory (i.e. `routes/admin.php`), you would add the following to `RouteServiceProvider.php`:

```php
    /**
     * Define the "web" routes for the application.
     *
     * These routes all receive session state, CSRF protection, etc.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function mapWebRoutes()
    {
     	Route::middleware('web')
             ->namespace($this->namespace)
             ->group(base_path('routes/web.php'))
             ->group(base_path('routes/admin.php'));
    }
```

#### Official Laravel Libraries ####

* **[Laravel Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/) - If you need to integrate with a payment API to provide subscription based billing to your SaaS application. This is a paid repository which handles all of the nitty-gritty scaffolding required for a SaaS application.
* **[Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/billing) - If you need to integrate with a payment API but don't need the subscription services associated with Laravel Spark.

#### Improving Application Security #### 

One of the most overlooked places to find security holes in a growing application are within it's open source dependencies. 
Several services exist which can track and monitor your dependencies and their current versions for known vulnerabilities.
We highly recommend and setting up 

##### Composer.json #####

* [Roave/SecurityAdvisories]() Add to your composer 

##### NPM #####

* [Node Security Platform - monitor](https://nodesecurity.io/) Subscribe and ensure that every Github pull request is audited for vulnerabilities in your current npm includes found in your `package.json` file.
* [DependencyCI](https://dependencyci.com/) If you are creating an open source project, there's no reason not to use Dependency CI for auditing dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/)
